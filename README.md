# Divi-child
Divi child theme via FreshySites

- Dedicated stylesheet with helpful classes and Divi fixes already applied
- Dedicated script file with Divi blurb-click helper class, and jQuery to make mobile sub menus be collapsible
- Child CSS and JS files have cache-busting technique added to URL to prevent browsers from hanging onto old cached versions
- Collaspislbe mobile sub menus that allow sub menus to be expanded and collapsed, while allowing the parent link to still work

<strong>Please note:</strong> you should remove the `-master` text from the `Divi-child` folder names, since GitHub adds those, and WordPress doesn't want them.
